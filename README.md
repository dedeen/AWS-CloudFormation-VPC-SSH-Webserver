# CloudFormation Templates: AWS VPC, KeyPair, EC2, WebServer Launch
This repo contains a set of scripts to build a VPC with multiple subnets, routes, IGW, and NATGW. In addition, it launches a functioning webserver (LAMP stack), configured and running, and accessible from the Internet via its public IP. This suite is fully functional and can be run in your account.
